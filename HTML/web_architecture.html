      <h3>What is Architecture in Web Development?</h3>
      <p>In web development, architecture refers to
        the structured design and organization of a web
        applicationâ€™s components, how they interact, and
        how data flows between them. It covers both the
        front-end (what users see and interact with) and the
        back-end (the server, database, and application logic
        that power the site behind the scenes).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box2">
      <h3>Core Elements of Web Architecture:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="core_element">Client-Side (Front-End):</span> The part of the
          application that runs in the user's browser, using
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render the interface.</li>
        <li><span>Server-Side (Back-End):</span> The server, application logic,
          and database that process requests, manage data, and send
          responses to the client.</li>
        <li><span>APIs:</span> Interfaces that enable communication between the
          front-end and back-end, or between different services.</li>
        <li><span>Data Storage:</span> Databases or other storage systems where
          application data is kept.</li>
        <li><span>Deployment & Hosting:</span> The infrastructure (cloud, on-premises, etc.)
          where the application runs.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="box3">
      <h3>Common Web Architecture Patterns</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Monolithic:</span> All components (UI, logic, data) are tightly
          integrated into a single application.</li>
        <li><span>Layered (N-Tier):</span> Separates concerns into layers (presentation,
          business logic, data), improving maintainability.</li>
        <li><span>Microservices:</span> Breaks the application into small, independent
          services that communicate over APIs, allowing for greater scalability and flexibility.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="box4">
      <h3>Why Architecture Matters?</h3>
      <p>Good web architecture ensures that an application is</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scalable (can handle growth in users/data)</li>
        <li>Maintainable (easy to update and debug)</li>
        <li>Secure (protects data and users)</li>
        <li>Performant (fast and responsive)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A well-designed web architecture is foundational for building robust,
        efficient, and scalable web applications.</p>
